<section id="about_me">
  <h2>Who is he?</h2>
  <p>
    Pengiran Nazrin has been in web development for the past 5 years in different capacities (from individual contributor to team leader), and all in the same company!
  </p>
  <p>
    Much of his work has revolved around developing applications using Ruby on Rails.
  </p>
  <p>
    While Ruby on Rails are his preferred tools, he always dabbles and keeps up to the date with the most widely used languages and frameworks on the market.
  </p>
  <p>
    He has plenty of interesting hobbies, including: playing video games, watching movies, reading comic books, and (most recently) collecting affordable watches.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recently, he has obtained his RCoC-B which certifies him as a UAS pilot.
